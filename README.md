# SportMate in android.
## Main idea: 
I like sports, however most of the sports are require two or more people. Sometimes it become pretty hard to find people to play with, special with someone who have closer skill. So in this app, people can pose what sport they want to play, the time, the location, and their skill level. Other user can see this pose and join the game. Now people can find a partner to play with.<br />

## Milestones:
First build server that can store user information<br />
Second build app in android<br />
Third add feature to submit pose and take request<br />
Fourth add searching feature<br />
