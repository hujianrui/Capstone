# e-UID in android
# Main idea: 
I am not a person that always carry my wallet with me. When I go to the Student Life Center without my wallet, I got trouble, because my student ID card are inside my wallet. However, I always have my small phone with me, so why not create an android app that can have all the information from you student ID card and never being lockout.<br />

# Milestones:
First need able to read information from the student ID card.<br /> 
Second need able to pass the information to the card reader. <br />

# Mentor: 
NA

# Skills/Tools:
Need learn RFID which is the tech that student ID card use.<br />
Need learn NFC which is the small phone use.<br />

# Risk:
First, the student ID card using LF (one type of RFID), then it is impossible for NFC to simulate the signal.  This is very unlikely, but still a risk. <br />
Second, the information inside the student card is encrypted, and the university reject to provide help in this part. Then we are unable to make it work. <br />
